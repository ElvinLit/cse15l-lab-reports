## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

**Student:** Hi CSE 15L TA, I am having trouble with some buggy code. I am currently attempting to implement insertion sort in java, but I am facing some issues in doing so. I have attached some screenshots for my code to show the issue.  
- Here is my implementation of insertion sort:
